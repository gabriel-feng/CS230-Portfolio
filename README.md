  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a company that wanted to further their application Draw It or Lose it, which was successful on mobile devices. They wanted to develop it so that it would work
on multiple platforms including PCs and other mobile devices through a web server.

  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe the best part of my design document was the domain model, as it clearly states the classes' interactions and relations to one another.

  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I believe that having a firm grasp of the domain model, requirements, and constraints were most helpful when developing the code.

  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I were to expand upon any part of my design document, I believe I could better explain to my client my recommendations on the operating platform, memory, and storage through 
more details and reasoning.

  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs as a requirement and constraint for the program, as the program isn't designed for the developers to use but their intended audience. Thus, the
user's needs are the most important when developing software of this nature.

  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I designed the program through referencing how others had done it before; and so if I were to develop a similar application, I would likely look for more reference material to
use and imitate.
